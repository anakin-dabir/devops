# awk

```bash
    awk '{print $1}' <file-name> | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5;
    # uniq -c: count the repeating ones
    # sort -nr: n(numerical), r(reverse, high -> low)

    awk 'BEGIN {} {} END {}';
    # BEGIN {} → Runs before processing any lines.
    # {} (Main Block) → Executes for each line in the file.
    # END {} → Executes after all lines have been processed.

    awk '{count[$1]++} END {for (ip in count) print count[ip], ip}' <file-name> | sort -nr -k1 | head -5;
    # -k1 : k - column no (in this case 1)
    
    awk -F'"' '{print $6}' $LOG_FILE | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5
    # -F: Field-separater (usually awk takes " " empty space as field separator to calculate columns)
```
