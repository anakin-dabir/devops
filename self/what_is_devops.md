# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy aimed at improving collaboration and integration between software development (**Dev**) and IT operations (**Ops**).  
It focuses on **automating and streamlining processes** to deliver software applications and services at high velocity, improving the **quality, reliability, and speed** of software delivery.

## Core Practices of DevOps

### 🔹 Continuous Integration (CI)

- Developers frequently merge code changes into a **shared repository**.
- **Automated testing** ensures that new changes don’t break the existing codebase.

### 🔹 Continuous Delivery (CD)

- Ensures that the software is **always in a deployable state**.
- Automates the **release process** to push code changes to production or staging environments.

### 🔹 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Treats **infrastructure (servers, networks) as code**.
- Allows infrastructure to be **version-controlled, automated, and easily replicable**.

### 🔹 Monitoring and Logging

- Tracks **system performance, application behavior, and errors** to ensure uptime.
- Tools like **Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack** are commonly used.

### 🔹 Collaboration and Communication

- Teams use tools like **Slack, Microsoft Teams**, and **shared dashboards** to foster open communication.
- **Agile methodologies** and **daily stand-ups** are common.

### 🔹 Automation

- **Automated testing, deployment, and configuration management** eliminate manual errors.
- Tools like **Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes** are widely used.
