What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy aimed at improving collaboration and integration between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It focuses on automating and streamlining processes to deliver software applications and services at high velocity, improving the quality, reliability, and speed of software delivery.

Core Practices of DevOps:

Continuous Integration (CI):
Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository.
Automated testing ensures that new changes donâ€™t break the existing codebase.

Continuous Delivery (CD):
Ensures that the software is always in a deployable state.
Automates the release process to push code changes to production or staging environments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Treats infrastructure (servers, networks) as code.
Allows infrastructure to be version-controlled, automated, and easily replicable.

Monitoring and Logging:
Tracks system performance, application behavior, and errors to ensure uptime.
Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack are commonly used.

Collaboration and Communication:
Teams use tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and shared dashboards to foster open communication.
Agile methodologies and daily stand-ups are common.

Automation:
Automated testing, deployment, and configuration management are key to eliminating manual errors.
Tools like Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes are widely used.
